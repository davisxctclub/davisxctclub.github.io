		<h1>
			Welcome to The UC Davis Cross Country & Track Club
		</h1>
		<p>
			 We have a wide variety of people ranging from those who are just looking to get into running, all the way to those that have been running for many years at a high level. The club is a supportive place for all abilities and types of runners, and we enjoy the balance that exists on our team. We always love to welcome new members!
		</p>
		<p>
			We do not have a coach, but rather are self-coached by the officers of the club.  With many years of quality running experience and knowledge, as well as some being current assistant coaches for local cross country programs, our officers develop weekly training plans geared towards success.  We have training plans and zones for all levels of runners, and look forward to helping every member achieve their individual, and team goals.
		</p>

		<h1>
			What We Are About
		</h1>
		<p>
			We aim to provide competitive and recreational running opportunities for students of all abilities. We compete under a larger organization NIRCA (National Intercollegiate Running Club Association). Most competitions we participate in are located in Northern California with an occasional out of state competition. Our main goal is to offer a fun, inclusive, social environment for all members of the club. We are all at Davis for school, with a common interest of running, so why not run together!
		</p>

		<h1>
			How to Join
		</h1>
		<p>
			Join the Facebook group for updates and information (the link is on the icon on the bottom of this page). Join the e-mail list (Just email this email [davisxctclub@gmail.com] saying you would like to join). Check out a few practices to decide if you would like to join. If interested, please pay $30 dues which covers the entire academic year (T-shirt included with dues). Dues go towards travel cost, apparel, paying NIRCA to participate as an official club team, and other items.
		</p>

		<h1>
			Practice
		</h1>
		<p>
			We meet at 4:00 PM Mon-Fri at the entrance of the Woody Wilson Track on campus (Corner of Russell and A Street). We start practice at 4:10 PM since some classes may end at 4:00 PM. If you have valuables or personal belongings, please put them in the Hickey Gym locker room before 4:10 PM. Locker room code provided at practice. Finish time depends on the workout (approx. 5:30-6:00 PM). Feel free to leave early if you have class or other commitments. Attend practice at your convenience.  Saturday day practice locations and times will be TBA throughout the year. Workout schedule will be provided at the beginning of the quarter. We have multiple routes/directions to run off campus. 
		</p>

		<h1>
			Competitions
		</h1>
		<p>
		Consistent attendance at practice is highly recommended for competing athletes (or equivalent training on your own). Most races are NCAA invitationals, or NIRCA sponsored club specific races.  We also participate in local fun runs/road races. Races are usually an average of $20 per entry paid by the athlete. However, travel cost is covered for club associated competitions. Cross Country season occurs in the Fall and Track & Field season occurs in the Spring. Race details will be released at the beginning of each season. 
		</p>

			Before most races we will have pasta parties which all are welcome to come whether you are racing or not. We will also have other various social events and fundraisers throughout the year and they will be TBA.
