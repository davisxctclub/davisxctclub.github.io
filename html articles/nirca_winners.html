			2015 - A Successful Season for Davis XC
		</h1>

        <p>In only the second year of existence for the Davis XC & Track Club, the club shattered expectations in almost every category. Over the summer, 15 club members spent one week training at elevation at Mammoth, CA. This trip was a great way for athletes to get to know each other on a deeper level and start building bonds for the year, as well as log some quality miles. Various club members also tabled at all of UC Davis’ Freshmen Orientation sessions, garnering interest from over 100 prospective members. </p>

        <p> As the school year started, the club consistently had about 30 people attending practice, roughly doubling attendance from the previous year. As the competing season started, we started running PR’s left and right. The men’s team placed 17th out of 30 in the NCAA D1 race at Stanford Invitational. At the NIRCA level, the men’s team won its consecutive Pacific Regional Championship, while the women’s team won its first ever Pacific Regional Championship. The first five men placed in the Top 10 of the race, while the women placed three runners in the Top 10. </p>

        <p> The season culminated at the NIRCA National Championships. Nine men and five women travelled over 2,000 miles to Lexington, Kentucky for their first Nationals appearance. The women’s team placed 11th in the nation, while the men’s team placed 1st. The Davis XC & Track club boasts three 1st team All-Americans selections (Nathan Kwan, Adam Cobert, and Jon Horvath) and one 2nd team All-American selection (Clancy McConnell). The club looks to continue its momentum into the track season and defy standards set for itself.</p>
